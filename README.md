# Oak Knoll
Once you get used to it, it's be a great tool.

## Basic Setup
First things first, inspect element, open the console, and copy and paste this into it:
```
let oakKnoll = window.open("https://oak-knoll-www.codesalvageon.repl.co/", "", "width=301,height=601");
```
After which you'll most likely see a new window pop up with funky looking buttons.

## Using (Built-in) Widgets
* To add a widget, click on one of the various "+" buttons on the window. 
* Once you've done that, select a widget from the widget menu.

My personal favorite combinations to use:

## Custom Widgets and Scripts
* To run a custom script, use the calculator widget and paste your script in.
* (Obviously, the script won't run right if its for a specific webpage because Oak Knoll is a web window.)
### Custom widget script example
You can find an example of a custom widget script [here](https://github.com/CodeSalvageON/Oak-Knoll-WWW/blob/main/widgets/slowdown.js).
* The above script slows down your local network, so don't run it if you don't know what you're doing!

  Hover over your browser's icon and wait to see the "preview" of the Oak Knoll window. That, or just run the script again.

  <summary><b>Best combination?</b></summary>
  For general use, I'd suggest Exurb Imperium, Proxy, and Overpass. However, for more practical uses, I would suggest Overpass, Proxy, and Calculator.
