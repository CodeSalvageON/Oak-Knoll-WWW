# Oak Knoll
Once you get used to it, it's be a great tool.

## Basic Setup
First things first, inspect element, open the console, and copy and paste this into it:
```
let oakKnoll = window.open("https://oak-knoll-www.codesalvageon.repl.co/", "", "width=301,height=601");
```
After which you'll most likely see a new window pop up with funky looking buttons.

## Using (Built-in) Widgets
* To add a widget, click on one of the various "+" buttons on the window. 
* Once you've done that, select a widget from the widget menu.

My personal favorite combinations to use:
